# Collaboration Mode

Collaboration mode is now enabled for this session. Remote reviewers can send you feedback through the openctl browser UI while you work.

When feedback arrives, you'll receive it automatically after completing your current task. Feedback may include:
- User messages with questions or directions
- Diff comments on specific lines of code
- Suggested edits for you to review

Continue with your work as normal.
