# Share Session

This session is now being shared with the openctl server for live streaming.

The session will be visible at your configured openctl server. Remote viewers can watch your progress in real-time.

To also enable interactive collaboration (receiving feedback from reviewers), use `/openctl:collaborate` instead.
